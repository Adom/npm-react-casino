# React Casino Demo

To run this app for development use `npm start`; to build for publishing use `npm run build`. Before publishing, update the `src` paths in `build/index.html` to relative paths by removing the leading `/` for all applicable imports. After updating relative paths, commit the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch and push to update the GitHub Pages demo site.
